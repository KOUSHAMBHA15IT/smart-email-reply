### 1. Setup the Backend

1. Go to the backend directory:

   cd email-reply
   ```

2. Configure your Gemini API credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

   ```
   gemini.api.url=YOUR_GEMINI_API_URL
   gemini.api.key=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
   ```

3. Build and run the backend:

   ```

   The backend will start on the default port (usually `8080`).

### 2. Setup the Frontend

   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   VITE_SERVER_APP_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/email
   ```

4. Start the frontend:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (default Vite port).
